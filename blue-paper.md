## Blockchain Technical Overview

### Coin or Token?

In forking this blockchain, you are starting a new *coin* as defined by the following characteristics:

1. It operates on its own blockchain technology that keeps track of all transactions in a native cryptocurrency.

     If you pay for something with Bitcoin, each transaction is encrypted, anonymized, and publicly viewable. Similarly, this blockchain implements a public API endpoint of publicly viewable, encrypted, anonymized transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, this blockchain also keeps track of all USD transactions associated with trading.

2. It can be used as money. The long-term vision of Bitcoin is to be used as a currency in the economy. Because trading with USD is built in to this blockchain - even allowing trades to happen automatically, behind-the-scenes in occurrence with product sales - it is designed specifically for this purpose.

3. It can be mined. So far there have been two primary mining methods used to increase the supply of coins in a network, they are:

    • [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work)

    • [Proof of Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake)

     This blockchain technology proposes a third method called *Proof of Value*, in which new coins are mined only when its value has been proven to have increased as a result of a trade or transaction. The newly mined coin is given to the seller as a reward for transacting in a way that increased its value.

     The reward ceiling is adjusted by the overall dilutive effect of mining in order to minimize price volatility, with the goal being a coin whose value reflects its economic utility, leaving some room for trading (see *Deviation Rate* below), and a currency that prints itself only when needed, and increasingly stablizes with each transaction.

### Features

##### Proof of Value

• Proof of Value Assertions

• Assertion misvaluations, rejections, & corrected Proofs of Value

• Transaction Rewards

• The Reward Ceiling & dilution

• Long-term stability

##### Deviation Rate

• Standard Deviation

• Crypto trading

### Use Cases

##### Buying & selling crypto

• Purchasing coins with USD

• Listing coins for sale in USD

• Holding coins long-term (value investing)

##### Spending crypto as money

• Buying products & services with coins

• Investing in companies with coins

### Implications

• Accepting crypto as payment for products & services

• Long-term sustainability beyond USD
